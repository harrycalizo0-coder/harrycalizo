    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">
     <r><b>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk,<br>lying between the copies of 
      <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals <br>her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On 
      The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's <br>favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she 
      ; <br><b>felt she needed to be free.
    </r></p>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">
      She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar <br>Wilde quote proclaiming that 
      "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do". <br>Although many considered her pioneering work, 
      unraveling the secrets of the llama <ins>DNA</ins>. <br>to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something
      better to do.
